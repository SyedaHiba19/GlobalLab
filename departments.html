                    <p class="font-italic">Color Doppler is detection and finding motion of blood flow using a Color map that is incorporated standard format B-mode image.</p>
                    <p>It detects and interrogated large scale of region and blood flow, typically blue and red. It can also detected whether the blood moving toward or way
                      from the transducer.It has estimated frequency shift at each point at which motion is detected within an interrogated region,
                      thus yielding information on direction of motion and velocity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Shades of color blue and red used to reflect relative velocity of blood flow. All stationary objects showing in gray scale as a B-mode imaging.
                      The benefit of color Doppler is that information on the direction and relative Velocity of blood flow can be obtained. Color Doppler is limited by its
                      dependence on the relative angle of the transducer to the blood flow.</p>

                      <h3>2-D Echo</h3>
                      <p class="font-italic">What is a Doppler ultrasound?<br>A Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive test that can be used to estimate your blood
                         flow through blood vessels by bouncing high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) off circulating red blood cells. </p>
                      <p>A Doppler ultrasound may help diagnose many conditions, including:
                         <ul>
                           <li>Blood clots</li>
                           <li>Poorly functioning valves in your leg veins, which can cause blood or other fluids to pool in your legs (venous insufficiency).</li>
                           <li>Heart valve defects and congenital heart disease.</li>
                           <li>A blocked artery (arterial occlusion).</li>
                           <li>Decreased blood circulation into your legs (peripheral artery disease).</li>
                           <li>Bulging arteries (aneurysms).</li>
                           <li>Narrowing of an artery, such as in your neck (carotid artery stenosis).</li>
                         </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>A Doppler ultrasound can estimate how fast blood flows by measuring the rate of change in its pitch (frequency).
                        During a Doppler ultrasound, a technician trained in ultrasound imaging (sonographer) presses a small hand-held device (transducer),
                        about the size of a bar of soap, against your skin over the area of your body being examined, moving from one area to another as necessary.
                        This test may be done as an alternative to more invasive procedures, such as arteriography and venography, which involve injecting dye into
                        the blood vessels so that they show up clearly on X-ray images. A Doppler ultrasound test may also help your doctor check for injuries
                         to your arteries or to monitor certain treatments to your veins and arteries.</p>

                      <p class="font-italic">X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light. In a health care setting, a machines sends are individual
                        x-ray particles, called photons. These particles pass through the body. A computer or special film is used to record the images that are created.</p>
                      <p>Structures that are dense (such as bone) will block most of the x-ray particles, and will appear white. Metal and contrast media
                        (special dye used to highlight areas of the body) will also appear white. Structures containing air will be black, and muscle, fat,
                        and fluid will appear as shades of gray</p>
                      <br>

                      <h4>How the Test is Performed?</h4>
                      <p>The test is performed in a radiology department by an x-ray technologist. The positioning of the patient, x-ray machine, and film
                        depends on the type of study and area of interest. Multiple individual views may be requested.
                        Much like conventional photography, motion causes blurry images on radiographs, and thus, patients may be asked to hold their breath
                        or not move during the brief exposure (about 1 second).</p>
                      <br>

                      <h4>How to Prepare for the Test?</h4>
                      <p>Prior to the examination, Inform the health care provider if you are pregnant, may be pregnant, If abdominal studies
                        are planned and you have had a barium contrast study (such as a barium enema, upper GI series, or barium swallow) in the
                        last 4 days, the test may be delayed until the contrast has fully passed. You will remove all jewelery and wear a hospital
                         gown during the x-ray examination because metal and certain clothing can obscure the images and require repeat studies.</p>

                      <h3>P.F.T</h3>
                      <p class="font-italic">Pulmonary function tests are a group of tests that measure how well the lungs take in and release air and how well they
                        move gases such as oxygen from the atmosphere into the body’s circulation.</p>
                      <br>

                      <h4>How the Test is Performed</h4>
                      <p>Spirometry measures airflow. By measuring how much air you exhale, and how quickly, spirometry can evaluate a broad range of lung diseases.
                        In a spirometry test, while you are sitting, you breathe into a mouthpiece that is connected to an instrument called a spirometer. The
                        spirometer records the amount and the rate of air that you breathe in and out over a period of time. For some of the test
                        measurements, you can breathe normally and quietly. Other tests require forced inhalation or exhalation after a deep breath.
                        Sometimes you will be asked to inhale the substance or a medicine to see how it changes your test results.</p>
                      <br>

                      <h4>How to Prepare for the Test</h4>
                      <p>Do not eat a heavy meal before the test. Do not smoke for 4 to 6 hours before the test. You will get specific
                        instructions if you need to stop using bronchodilators or inhaler medications. You may have to breathe in medication
                        before or during the test.</p>
                      <br>

                      <h4>Why the Test is Performed</h4>
                      <p>Pulmonary function tests are done to:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Diagnose certain types of lung disease (such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema).</li>
                        <li>Find the cause of shortness of breath.</li>
                        <li>Measure whether exposure to chemicals at work affects lung function.</li>
                        <li>Check lung function before someone has surgery.</li>
                        <li>Assess the effect of medication.</li>

                      measurements, you can breathe normally and quietly. Other tests require forced inhalation or exhalation after a deep breath.
                      Sometimes you will be asked to inhale the substance or a medicine to see how it changes your test results.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>How to Prepare for the Test</h4>
                    <p>Do not eat a heavy meal before the test. Do not smoke for 4 to 6 hours before the test. You will get specific
                      instructions if you need to stop using bronchodilators or inhaler medications. You may have to breathe in medication
                      before or during the test.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Why the Test is Performed</h4>
                    <p>Pulmonary function tests are done to:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Diagnose certain types of lung disease (such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema).</li>
                      <li>Find the cause of shortness of breath.</li>
                      <li>Measure whether exposure to chemicals at work affects lung function.</li>
                      <li>Check lung function before someone has surgery.</li>
                      <li>Assess the effect of medication.</li>
                      <li>Measure progress in disease treatment.</li>
                    </ul>

                  <h3>Digital Orthopantomogram</h3>
                  <p class="font-italic">A stress test, sometimes called a treadmill test or exercise test, helps your doctor find out how well your heart handles its workload.
                     As your body works harder during the test, it requires more fuel and your heart has to pump more blood. The test can show if there’s a lack of blood
                     supply through the arteries that go to the heart. </p>
                  <br>

                  <h4>What Is an Exercise Stress Test?</h4>
                  <p>The exercise stress test – also called a stress test, exercise electrocardiogram, treadmill test, graded exercise test, or stress ECG – is used to provide
                    information about how the heart responds to exertion. It involves walking on a treadmill at increasing levels of difficulty, while your
                    electrocardiogram, heart rate, and blood pressure are monitored.</p>
                  <br>

                  <h4>Your doctor uses the stress test to:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Determine if there is adequate blood flow to your heart during increasing levels of activity.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of your heart medications to control angina and ischemia.</li>
                    <li>Determine the likelihood of having coronary heart disease and the need for further evaluation.</li>
                    <li>Check the effectiveness of procedures done to improve blood flow within the heart vessels in people with coronary heart disease.</li>
                    <li>Identify abnormal heart rhythms.</li>
                    <li>Help you develop a safe exercise program.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>

                  <h4>What happens during the test?</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You’re hooked up to equipment to monitor your heart.</li>
                    <li>You walk slowly in place on the treadmill.</li>
                    <li>It tilts so you feel like you’re going up a small hill.</li>
                    <li>It changes speeds to make you walk faster after certain time interval.</li>
                    <li>You can stop the test at any time if you need to.</li>
                  </ul>

                <h3>Sonography 4D</h3>
                <p class="font-italic">In ultrasonography, or ultrasound, high-frequency sound waves, inaudible to the human ear, are transmitted
                  through body tissues. The echoes are recorded and transformed into video or photographic images. 3D and 4D ultrasounds are optional.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>What the Test Does?</h4>
                <p>Like regular ultrasounds, 3D and 4D ultrasounds use sound waves to create an image of your baby in your womb. What’s different is that
                  3D ultrasounds create a three-dimensional image of your baby, while 4D ultrasounds create a live video effect, like a movie — you can
                  watch your baby smile or yawn. Parents often want 3D and 4D ultrasounds. They let you see your baby’s face for the first time. Some
                  doctors like 3D and 4D ultrasounds because they can show certain birth defects, such as cleft palate, that might not show up on a standard ultrasound.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>On the day of the test:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>It is very important to arrive with a full bladder. This allows the technologists and radiologist to view
                    the bladder while it is full and after it has been emptied.</li>
                  <li>Your ultrasound test is performed by registered, expert radiologists.</li>
                  <li>You may be asked to change into a hospital gown.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h4>How the Test Is Done?</h4>
                <p>For an abdominal ultrasound, you’ll lie down and a technician will put a certain gel on your belly. This helps carry the sound waves. Then the
                   radiologist will hold a probe against your belly and move it around to get an image.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>What to Know About Test Results</h4>
                <p>Afterward, you may get photos/CD or a copy of a 4D movie to take home. our doctor will inform you if anything seems unusual.</p>

                <h3>ECG</h3>
                <p class="font-italic">An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>How the Test is Performed?</h4>
                <p>You will be asked to lie down. The health care provider will attach small patches called electrodes to those areas. It may be
                  necessary to shave or clip some hair so the patches stick to the skin. The number of patches used may vary.</p>
                <p>The patches are connected by wires to a machine that turns the heart’s electrical signals into wavy lines, which are often printed on paper.
                   The doctor reviews the test results.</p>
                <p>You will need to remain still during the procedure. The health care provider may also
                   ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds as the test is being done. It is important to be relaxed and warm during an ECG
                   recording because any movement, including shivering, can alter the results.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>How to Prepare for the Test?</h4>
                <p>Make sure your health care provider knows about all the medicines you are taking. Some drugs can interfere with test results.
                   Do not exercise or drink cold water immediately before an ECG because these actions may cause false results.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Why the Test is Performed?</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Any damage to the heart.</li>
                  <li>How fast your heart is beating and whether it is beating normally.</li>
                  <li>The effects of drugs or devices used to control the heart (such as a pacemaker).</li>
                  <li>The size and position of your heart chambers.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>An ECG is often the first test done to determine whether a person has heart disease. Your doctor may order this test if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You have chest pain or palpitations.</li>
                  <li>You are scheduled for surgery.</li>
                  <li>You have had heart problems in the past.</li>
                  <li>You have a strong history of heart disease in the family.</li>
                </ul>
